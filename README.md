# House-sales-in-King-County

Makin'sights from a bunch of raw data

## Instalation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.

## Project
This project aims to use only the dataset to perform a visualization and obtain insights out of a place where we know nothing about.

## Main topics
1. Defining the most popular region
2. Statistics of both regions in details
3. The place of the most expensive deals
4. The big picture


## Files description
The files contained in this repository are basically the Jupyter Notebooks where I performed all of the analysis, a license, a folder containing some pictures used for writing my blog post and the dataset itself, obtained from Kaggle. The full analysis is displayed in the 'Full Dataset Analysis' file

## The Dataset
This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. The data contains many aspects of the sold houses including prices, features, size, number of rooms, local, dates and more.


## Results
It has been found that the dataset can be turned into images describing many visual, economical and spacial aspects of the studied place just by making sense of the data. A full report describing the main findings of the analysis can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@gugmt15/making-sights-from-a-bunch-of-raw-data-a25c37db8901).
