### House-sales-in-King-County

An analysis of the data using Machine Learning and Descriptive Statistics

## Instalation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.

## Project
This project aims to use only the dataset to perform a visualization and obtain insights out of a place where we know nothing about.

## Main topics
1. Defining the most popular region
2. Statistics of both regions in details
3. The place of the most expensive deals
4. The big picture


## Files description
The files contained in this repository are basically the Jupyter Notebooks where I performed all of the analysis, some pictures used for writing my blog post and the dataset itself, obtained from Kaggle.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@gugmt15/making-sights-from-a-bunch-of-raw-data-a25c37db8901).
